  # Stat is a data structure that allows accumulating performance data (route
  # performance, SQL query performance and such). It's powered by TDigests.
  #
  # Usually, one Stat corresponds to one resource (route or query,
  # etc.). Incrementing a stat means pushing new performance statistics.
  #
  # @example
  #   stat = Airbrake::Stat.new
  #   stat.increment(Time.now - 200)
  #   stat.to_h # Pack and serialize data so it can be transmitted.
  #
  # @since v3.2.0

    # @param [Integer] count How many times this stat was incremented
    # @param [Float] sum The sum of duration in milliseconds
    # @param [Float] sumsq The squared sum of duration in milliseconds
    # @param [TDigest::TDigest] tdigest Packed durations. By default,
    #   compression is 20
